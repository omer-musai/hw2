Concepts & ideas:
1. Characters are "blind" (in the sense that only the Game class has knowledge of the board)




Methods:
- Game:
    Contains a vector of characters, each of which contains its own position.

- Character:
    attack (likely pure virtual because every inheriting class implements it differently, I think?)
    private:
        contain a gridpoint




If something is constant, just move it to public.
Else, consider if protected, private, or a public getter/setter.
